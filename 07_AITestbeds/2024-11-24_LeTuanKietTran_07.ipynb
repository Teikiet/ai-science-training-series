    "## 1. What are the key architectural features that make these systems suitable for AI workloads?  \n",
    "AI accelerators like SambaNova, Cerebras, Graphcore, and Groq are tailored for AI tasks due to their specialized hardware optimized for matrix multiplications and tensor operations. They feature high memory bandwidth and substantial on-chip memory to handle memory-intensive workloads. Additionally, their architectures emphasize scalability and parallelism, enabling efficient data processing across multiple cores, which significantly accelerates training and inference.\n",

    "## 2. Identify the primary differences between these AI accelerator systems in terms of their architecture and programming models.  \n",
    "- **SambaNova**: Its Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU) enables flexible dataflow processing, supported by a multi-tiered memory design with terabytes of addressable memory, ideal for large datasets.  \n",
    "- **Cerebras**: The Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE) uses independent processing elements (PEs) with dedicated memory and fine-grained dataflow control, enabling high parallelism and scalability.  \n",
    "- **Graphcore**: The Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) integrates many interconnected processing tiles, each with local memory. It employs Bulk Synchronous Parallelism (BSP), alternating between computation and communication phases.  \n",
    "- **Groq**: The Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP) focuses on deterministic execution, which is particularly beneficial for low-latency inference tasks.\n",

    "## 3. Based on hands-on sessions, describe a typical workflow for refactoring an AI model to run on one of ALCF's AI testbeds (e.g., SambaNova or Cerebras). What tools or software stacks are typically used in this process?  \n",
    "The workflow generally involves using vendor-specific machine learning framework implementations, such as adapting models from PyTorch to PopTorch or converting them using SambaFlow. Documentation and examples provided by the vendors are key resources for understanding and executing the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Give an example of a project that would benefit from AI accelerators and why.  \n",
    "Deep learning-based cancer diagnosis is a prime example. Processing medical images like MRIs and CT scans for early cancer detection requires intensive computations. AI accelerators expedite training and inference while enabling real-time diagnostics and reducing power consumption. Benefits include quicker and more accurate diagnoses, improved research capabilities, and cost savings. Suitable accelerators for such tasks include SambaNova's RDU, Cerebras' WSE, Graphcore's IPU, and Groq's TSP, all of which contribute to better patient outcomes and advancements in medical research.\n"
